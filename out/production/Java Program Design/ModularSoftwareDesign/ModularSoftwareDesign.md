Two Common development Methodoligiees
    WaterFall
        - This is a process where you create a design for the program
        - Iteratively revising the design untill user are happy.
          Then you write the whole program, hoping that the first version will be 
          satisfactory. It rarely is. Even if you manage to implement the design perfectly.
    Agile Methodology
        - Program design and Implementation occur in tandem.
        - You start by implementing the bare bones of the program
        - Each Subsuquent version implementing a bare bones version of 
            additional feature.
        - The idea is that each version contains "just Enough" code to make the 
            chosen subset of feature work.
